 * Interface for views on a data object. A view provides visualization settings

 * a {@link Display}. In other words, a <em>view</em> links a
 * <em>data object</em> with one or more <em>displays</em>.

 * .class. While it possible to create a view merely by implementing this
 * interface, it is encouraged to instead extend
 * {@link imagej.view.DefaultView}, for convenience.
